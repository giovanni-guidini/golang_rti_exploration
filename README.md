This repo contains some test code for golang open telemetry.

- `cover` contains a modified copy of the coverage tool. 
- `otel-tutorial` has an attempt at connection opentelemetry package and line coverage. Not working.
- `cover-with-runtime` has a simple file to explore getting coverage data from `runtime.Caller`, verify if the implementation to get Goroutine ID works (it does), and explore the effects of multithreads for a centralized coverage reference.

This is a random test in something not related to anything in this repo
